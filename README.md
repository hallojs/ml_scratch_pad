Here I just play around with numpy to implement neuronal networks from scratch for my own understanding.

## Notebooks
1. nn_from_scratch_with_np: In this notebook we develop a neural network from scratch using only Numpy. We develop the code based on the excellent [tutorial](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/) by Victor Zhou.

2. nn_from_scratch_with_np2: This notebook is only a minimal extension of the first notebook. The only thing we add here is a second output neuron. The activation function, the data and the rest of the architecture remain the same.
