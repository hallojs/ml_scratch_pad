Here I just play around with NumPy to implement ML stuff from scratch for my own understanding.

## Notebooks
1. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hallojs/nn_scratch_np/blob/master/nn_from_scratch_with_np.ipynb) nn_from_scratch_with_np: In this notebook we develop a neural network from scratch using only NumPy. We develop the code based on the excellent [tutorial](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/) by Victor Zhou.

2. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hallojs/nn_scratch_np/blob/master/nn_from_scratch_with_np2.ipynb) nn_from_scratch_with_np2: This notebook is only a minimal extension of the first notebook. The only thing we add here is a second output neuron. The activation function, the data and the rest of the architecture remain the same.

3. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hallojs/nn_scratch_np/blob/master/linear_regression.ipynb) linear_regression: Implementation of linear regression on the [diabetes dataset](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~boos/var.select/diabetes.html).
